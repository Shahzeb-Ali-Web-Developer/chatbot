# AI Chatbot

This is a offline AI chatbot that responds to predefined questions and answers using sentence similarity. It’s implemented in Python and uses the `sentence-transformers` library to find the best answer match based on user input.

## Features

- **Offline and Lightweight**: No server or internet connection is needed; it runs locally on your computer.
- **Predefined FAQ Responses**: Responds based on a predefined set of FAQs.
- **Similarity Matching**: Uses sentence embeddings to find the closest match to the user’s question.
- **Easy Customization**: You can easily add more questions and answers to improve the chatbot’s responses.
